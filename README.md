<p>A Python application used to export equity, ETF and Mutual Fund trade history into a CSV file.</p>
<p><strong>***BUGS DISOVERED IN APP WHEN USERS SUBMIT</strong></p>
<p>Currently researching a few bugs with the Price History App due to some instabillities with Tkinter and Cx_Freeze. The Command line version has been tested and deployed succesfully.</p>

<h2>Installation instructions:</h2>
<p>Download the files into a destination directory.</p>

<h2>To Open:</h2>
<p>Double click on 'historical_pricing_app.exe'.</p>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
<ol><li><p>Enter desired date range.  Click Submit Dates. If an invalid date was entered, a warning will populate.</p></li>
<li><p>Add equities and ETFs to ticker table by typing the desired symbol into the Ticker Symbol field. Click "Add Ticker".</p></li>
<ol><li><p>To remove a symbol from the  Table, type it into the Ticker Symbol field. Click "Remove Ticker" Button.</p></li></ol>
<li><p>Click "Request Tickers" button to download the requested data.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to the app directory. A CSV file name "Ticker_Table" with the current date will be saved.</p></li></ol><br>


<p>Need to add additional tickers? No sweat, add or remove additional tickers using Step 2. Click "Request Tickers" and the data will append to your existing file.</p>
